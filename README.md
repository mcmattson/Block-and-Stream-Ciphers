# Block-and-Stream-Ciphers
The purpose of this project is to familiarize with the concept of block ciphers and stream ciphers. Block ciphers work on blocks of n bits at a time. Stream ciphers work on streams one bit at a time. This program will read in an input file and apply the algorithms described below. It will then generate an output file.

# Final Product
A product that encrypts and decrypts from an input file to a output file using one of two methods, Stream and Block Ciphers.
