# Block-and-Stream-Ciphers
The purpose of this assignment is to familiarize with the concept of block ciphers and stream ciphers. Block ciphers work on blocks of n bits at a time. Stream ciphers work on streams one bit at a time. This program will read in an input file and apply the algorithms described below. It will then generate an output file.
