# Block-and-Stream-Ciphers
The purpose of this assignment is to familiarize with the concept of block ciphers and stream ciphers. Block ciphers work on blocks of n bits at a time. Stream ciphers work on streams one bit at a time. This program will read in an input file and apply the algorithms described below. It will then generate an output file.

# What to turn in
You should submit your makefile, your C or C++ programs, and a README to the assignment in Canvas. The README should contain everything the TA should know to execute your program. Remember: It is your responsibility to test your on the state capital machines - that is where the TA will grade it.
